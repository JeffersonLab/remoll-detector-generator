# 1 - ring number (1-6, 5 is primary moller peak and is further segmented in each open, transition and closed segment into 3 sub-tiles)
# 2 - radial position of the center of the piece of quartz (710-1150, determined by Yuxiang/Ciprian's optimization simulations)
# 3 - length of quartz (40-140 mm, determined by Yuxiang/Ciprian's optimization simulations)
# 4 - overlap (0-1, should be 1 for maximum overlap)
# 5 - thickness of quartz (lets say 10mm, may be thicker for some rings to maximize yield)
# 6 - quartz tilt angle (should be between 0.0 degrees and 3.0 degrees, probably just 3.0 for all)
# 7 - roll angle (90 degrees always)
# 8 - reflector length (variable, mm, from simulation)
# 9 - reflector top opening angle (variable, degrees, from simulation)
# 10 - reflector depth (variable, mm, if == -1 then be constrained to parallelogram from PMT)
# 11 - light guide opening angle (variable, degrees, depends on reflector angle, maxes at 6 in new Syracuse support design)
# 12 - PMT cathode origin hall-coordinates-radius
# 13 - diameter of PMT (3 inches default)
# 14 - PMT length (6 inches default)
# 15 - wall thickness (3mm default)
# 16 - pmt holder additional width
# 17 - pmt holder additional depth
# 18 - z position of quartz central point
# 19 - z pos for staggered one.
